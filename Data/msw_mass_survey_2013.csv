Because of seasonal (move-out) craziness we do not track the number of student households that take advantage of this benefit.  As there are over 24,000 students attending college in Amherst, this easily brings the number of households utilizing our transfer station to over 2000.

Question 8: PAYT compost collection program began April 2013.

Question 9: EPS shipping peanuts are collected year-round at Transfer Station for reuse (made available free of charge to individuals, small businesses & UPS Store).  Single-use EPS serveware is banned in Amherst as of 1/1/2014; We assume ""household batteries"" refers to alkaline batteries, which we do not collect.  We collect auto, all rechargeables and button batteries year-round.

For the past 2 years the Town has held a styrofoam collection event the first Saturday after Christmas. This event has been very successful and is open to the general public. 

In the future we would like to hold a recycling event in the Spring and Fall. The one in the Spring would be around Earth Day and the Fall event would coincide with Household Hazardous Waste Day. We will also continue to hold the December holiday styrofoam collection event.",

Also, the public school department has a program whereby they recycle food waste at a local farm.

Bulky Rigid Plastic - We are charged a $124 processing fee each time they collect which ends up costing us money in the end even with the $15/ton credit.

Scrap Metal/White Goods - We are given $210.00 per ton of scrap metal, but we do not make money on white goods.  Our white goods are collecting together with our e-waste so the tonnage shown on this line is a total of all scrap metal, white goods, and e-waste combined.  The cost of our white goods and e-waste is built into our total contract price so we do not have a per ton price.",
