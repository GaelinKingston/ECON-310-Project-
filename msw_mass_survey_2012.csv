As there are over 24,000 students attending college in Amherst, this easily brings the number of households utilizing our transfer station to over 2000.

Question 9: EPS shipping peanuts were collected year-round at Transfer Station for reuse (made available free of charge to individuals, small businesses & UPS Store); We assume ""household batteries"" refers to alkaline batteries, which we do not collect.

It has nothing for residents except the following:
1. The town has partially funded a Drop-off Center located in East Wareham for recyclable items only.  In addition to the routine items the center handles: paint(both oil based and latex), tires, lead core and rechargeable batteries, flourescent lamps and bulbs, other mercury bearing items, i.e. thermostats, thermometers and smoke detectors, old flags, white metal goods and misc. metal of all types.  No sticker is required.

As of July 1, 2013, the Town is eliminating the funds for any recycling activity.  This action jeopardizes our ability to operate the center.  In addition, it effectively eliminates the Recycling Coordinator from the town budget which will leave Wareham with no focal point for recycling.  The position of the town Board of Selectmen is that volunteers should handle all the activities and that the center should be self-sustaining.  The Coordinator spends at least 20 hours per week on recycling duties.  These will be dropped or be absorbed by other town departments.  This is yet to be addressed by the Board of Selectmen or the Town Adminstrator.
2.  The town of Wareham participates in the ""Carver, Marion, Wareham Regional Refuse Disposal District.  This provides residents with two transfer facilities for trash and some recyclables disposal.  These facilities are located in Rochester and Marion.  There will not be any recycling facility in Wareham.  A sticker is required and residents can purchase these at the Harbormasters office in Wareham.",
