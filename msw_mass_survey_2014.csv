There is an annual sticker for the recycling center, but that does not cover the cost of curbside collection, nor is it adequate to cover costs for the recycling center. I therefore said fees fund our program, but that is only a tiny fraction of our revenue. Gate fees are our main source of revenue. The recycling center fees are $30 for a sticker with $20 for seniors and $10 for a replacement sticker. Plus, there are fees for certain items once an allotment of free bulky items stickers are used. More information can be found on our web page at townofbourne.com.We do accept recyclables from businesses and some condos we pick up from, but MSW is limited to the town of Falmouth through their contract with us for their residential curbside collection program. Therefore, as we have switched to accepting almost all municipal waste combustor ash, and don't take commercial hauler business MSW anymore, the listing under the Municipal program has changed. We also take MSW from our own curbside collection program. The number of households has been refined to reflect the small amount of multi-family units we collect from and a trailer park as of the date of the attached form. Our paint shed is open seasonally from April - May on Fridays and Saturdays. Bulky waste and MSW are disposed of in our landfill at no charge..",

New businesses are not allowed to be collected, private haulers are hired. Recycled goods are picked-up if anyone places them curbside. Some condo's do not offer recycling and those residents use the town curbside service by leaving the goods on the curb because the hauler will not enter ""private property"". There was no space to detail how curbside recycling is paid: contract for pick-up and hauling to recycling facilities is paid from tax base. In March 2015 we will move to the two-cart system and we are very hopeful the recycling rate will greatly increase and the MSW will decrease. We currently use the antiquated 18 gallon recycle bins.",
