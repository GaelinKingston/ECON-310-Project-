Generally, to dump waste at our transfer station one must purchase a punch card to do so. Any town resident or business can use the transfer station to dispose of the recycling items as long as they show proof of residency. We do not sell or provide transfer station stickers. The PAYT program collects enough money to cover our costs, but we appropriate in our budget the amount we believe will collect in PAYT payments instead of setting up a revolving fund. This year we checked the ""property tax"" box because our appropriation included budget appropriation and free cash to purchase a new compactor as well funds tor new controls as well as new decking and bringing transfer station up to code compliance.Our transfer station attendant monitors and enforces the mandatory recycling requirement at the transfer station. Local private haulers are responsible for enforcing the mandatory recycling for their customers.While town residents did not have access to a comprehensive household hazardous waste collection ""event"" in another community in 2015, the town did contract with NEDT to allow residents of Granville to utilize the NEDT Household Hazardous Products Collection Center in neighboring Westfield. The Town set up the program to allow residents the opportunity to dispose of a comprehensive list of hazardous products not accepted at the Transfer Station. To incentivize the program the Town pays the first $30 of residents' costs for disposal. Program is advertised at the Transfer Station, on the Town website and in the local monthly newsletter.",,

Our downtown is very dense and businesses are allowed to put out their weekly recycling for collection by our hauler. We also offer recycling dropoff at our transfer station to condos and apartments not served curbside.
