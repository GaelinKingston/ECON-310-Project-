Punch cards cost $75.00 and can be purchased in four bag size preferences: Sixty 13-gallon punches; Thirty 30-gallon punches; twenty 42-gallon punches and fifteen 50-gallon punches. We do not sell or provide stickers. The PAYT program collects enough money to cover our costs, but we appropriate in our budget the amount we believe we will collect in PAYT payments instead of setting up a revolving fund. Our transfer station attendant monitors and enforces the mandatory recycling requirement at the transfer station. Local private haulers are responsible for enforcing the mandatory recycling for their customers. In lieu of residents having access to a comprehensive household hazardous waste collection event in another community, the town does contract with NEDT Household Hazardous Products Collection Center in neighboring Westfield to provide year-round opportunity to dispose of a comprehensive list of hazardous products not accepted at the Transfer Station. To incentivize the program the Town pays the first $30 of residents' costs for disposal. This program is advertised at the Transfer Station, on the Town websites and several times a year in the local monthly newsletter. Nearly one ton (0.82) of hazardous materials were collected in CY 2016 at NEDT from Granville residents.",,

Ipswich has an opt-in, private-pay curbside composting program. Residents pay $1 per week and the DPW pays 10 cents per household per week. The approximate total cost for 2016 (with fluctuating rates of participation by season) to the DPW was $2,545. This is a reduction from prior years because our new contract does not charge a tipping fee. Our trash and recycling household numbers are different because we collect recycling from some residences and businesses that we do not serve with trash hauling. We have a very dense downtown and our hauler picks up recycling from there as well. We also offer recycling dropoff at our transfer station. In addition, we serve curbside trash and recycling pickup to multi-family residences (four units or more) that were ""grandfathered in"" before the new trash policy was adopted. The textile tonnage is an estimate from our schools' bins based on reports from the schools. They receive $100 per ton. In addition, we have an American Red Cross box at our transfer station that collected approximately 1.5 tons, but it is not included in the total because we receive no payment and there isn't an option above to separate the two. E-waste is estimated using EPA.gov conversion amounts, because we are charged for e-waste per unit, not by weight. In the past, we included our e-waste with the Recycling Committee's 3 town events, but now we have our own recycling pickups. Ipswich has two dumpsters for scrap metal, one at the transfer station for residents and the other at the DPW yard for municipal buildings and schools. Our bulky items include furniture, mattresses and box springs, and carpet. Appliances can be brought to the transfer station for free or picked up curbside by pre-paying for pickup with the hauler (not the town). As mentioned above, e-waste is separate from bulky items.",,

Lynnfield, through our hauler, collects appliances, grills, humidifiers, lawnmowers, and other items via pre-paying for pickup to the hauler. Because we receive tallies from the hauler in units and not weight, it is difficult to estimate diverted weight. Lynnfield hosts Planet Aid boxes at town hall for textiles, but numbers were not available at reporting time. Lynnfield's hauling contract expired in June, and the $25 per ton rebate for recycling paper was replaced with a $25 per ton cost for all recyclables. Because there is not a method for splitting the calendar year (hauling contract runs by fiscal year), it seemed best to use the new recycling costs because those are the numbers going forward through 2021. Actual paper and comingled recyclables costs reported here are approximately half for calendar year 2016. E-waste is similar to appliances, because TVs and monitor pickups are prepaid to the hauler and reported in units. Weight estimates were made using the EPA conversion amounts.",,

The correct yard waste tonnage for CY 2015 is 256 tons. The loss is due to closure of the municipal landfill. 2) In 2016 our ReCenter Swap Shop recorded all outgoing material by weight. During the 20 half Saturdays the swap shop was open between 4/9/16 and 10/30/16, we diverted 14 tons of material from the landfill. Of that, 13.8 tons was ""adopted"" by swap shop visitors and reuse partners (e.g. Salvation Army and Eco Building Bargains). ""Unadoptable"" material totaled a mere 1.4 tons (.8 ton was recycled and .6 ton was sent to the landfill).

The reason I would like to discuss this is the Town's collection contractor goes by each of the households in Town and the private hauler customers can use both services. Having ore than 5000 households being served would double the value of the points awarded in RDP funds.,,

Following award of DEP Mattress grant, 184 additional mattresses were collected under the grant program.In 2016, Sherborn began separately collecting porcelain fixtures to send to Conigliaro Industries for pulverization into recycling into aggregate for construction purposes at a cost of $15 per unit plus $90 labor per load. Hardware and other non-porcelain material must be removed to avoid a $5 per unit extra charge. Drop-off customers are now charged $15 per unit. There appeared to be no appropriate place on the survey to report this effort, and although it seems worthwhile to reduce this trash tonnage, even at the risk of incurring some added cost (it is cheaper to ship/tip as trash). We shipped around 80 discarded toilet/sink units during the year, and inventory was building at year's end.",,
